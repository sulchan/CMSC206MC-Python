    "1. Write a program to prompt user for four integer values. Display max and min of the 4 integer values. As an enhancement, display running total, or other enhancements of your choice. Finally, write up your findings of the enhancements.\n",
    "2. Write a program to prompt a value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusively. If the value is out of range, print an error message. If the value is between the 0.0 and 1.0, print the corresponding letter grade.\n",
